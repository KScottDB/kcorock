Very, very unfinished.

In fact, still a Hello World program at the time of
writing.

NodeGui requirements rewritten here for lazy people like me
(as of 1/3/2020):

- A 64-bit OS
- CMake 3.1+
- NodeJS 12.x+
- Make/GCC v7 (MacOS/Linux)
- Visual Studio >=2017 (Windows)
- `pkg-config` and `build-essential` (Ubuntu)

After that, it's as simple as typing

```
git clone https://github.com/KScottDB/kcorock.git
cd kcorock
npm i
npm start
```

in your shell.
